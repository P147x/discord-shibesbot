# Shibesbot
**Get your daily dose of shibes on Discord !**

The purpose of the Shibesbot is to deliver pictures, gifs or wallpapers of dog (especially Shiba Inu) when you ask him on Discord, whether it is on a server or when you send him a private message. There is not really utility here, but, shibes dude.

## How can i get this bot on my server ?
You can invite the Shibesbot directly from here. No permissions asked, he'll be sage.

## Discord commands
Many commands has been implemented. As previously described, you can ask for pictures, animated or not.

- `shelp` : You don't know how this bot works ? You can type this command to get the list of implemented commands. We give you a hint behind the bot's name.
- `shibes` : The main command. This is give you an random picture of a Shiba Inu instantly. 
- `sgifs` : Static pictures are mainstream ? No problem, with this command dude, you get an awesome animated shibe.
- `swalls` : Gives you a wallpaper with a shibe on it.


That is all for the moment. Maybe in a near future, there will be more commands. I don't know, a doge lottery ? Who knows, we are open to suggestions !

## API used
I used public APIs to permit this bot to gives you a lot of shibe, so, obviously, i have to quote them.
